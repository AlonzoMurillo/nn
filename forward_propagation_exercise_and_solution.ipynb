    "## 🧠 Theoretical Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward propagation** is the process by which input data is fed through a neural network, layer by layer, to produce an output prediction. Each layer in the network performs two main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linear Transformation:** A linear combination of the inputs from the previous layer with the current layer's weights, plus a bias term. For a layer $l$, this is calculated as:\n",
    "    $$Z^{[l]} = W^{[l]}A^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}$$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    * $A^{[l-1]}$ is the activation (output) from the previous layer (or the input data $X$ for the first layer, $A^{[0]} = X$).\n",
    "    * $W^{[l]}$ is the weight matrix for the current layer $l$.\n",
    "    * $b^{[l]}$ is the bias vector for the current layer $l$.\n",
    "    * $Z^{[l]}$ is the linear output of layer $l$, sometimes called the pre-activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Activation Function:** A non-linear function applied element-wise to $Z^{[l]}$ to produce the output (activation) of the current layer $A^{[l]}$.\n",
    "    $$A^{[l]} = g^{[l]}(Z^{[l]})$$\n",
    "    Where $g^{[l]}$ is the activation function for layer $l$. Common activation functions include:\n",
    "    * **Sigmoid:** $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$. Often used in the output layer for binary classification problems as it squashes values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    * **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** $ReLU(z) = \\max(0, z)$. Commonly used in hidden layers due to its efficiency and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an **L-layer neural network**, this process is repeated for $L-1$ hidden layers, typically using an activation function like ReLU. The final output layer then uses an appropriate activation function for the task (e.g., Sigmoid for binary classification, Softmax for multi-class classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a generic `L_model_forward` function that performs forward propagation for a network with the following architecture:\n",
    "`[LINEAR -> RELU] * (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means all hidden layers will use the ReLU activation function, and the output layer will use the Sigmoid activation function. You will also need to implement helper functions for the linear step and for applying activations.\n",

    "## 📋 Exercise Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to complete the Python functions provided in the code cells below. Specifically, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Implement `sigmoid(Z)`:** Computes the sigmoid activation.\n",
    "2.  **Implement `relu(Z)`:** Computes the ReLU activation.\n",
    "3.  **Complete `initialize_parameters_deep(layer_dims)`:** Initializes weights and biases for an L-layer network.\n",
    "    * Weights $W$ should be initialized with small random numbers (e.g., `np.random.randn(shape) * 0.01`).\n",
    "    * Biases $b$ should be initialized to zeros (e.g., `np.zeros(shape)`).\n",
    "4.  **Complete `linear_forward(A_prev, W, b)`:** Implements the linear part of a layer's forward propagation ($Z = WA + b$).\n",
    "5.  **Complete `linear_activation_forward(A_prev, W, b, activation)`:** Implements one step of forward propagation (LINEAR -> ACTIVATION). This function will use `linear_forward` and then apply either `relu` or `sigmoid` based on the `activation` argument.\n",
    "6.  **Complete `L_model_forward(X, parameters)`:** Implements the full forward propagation for the `[LINEAR->RELU]*(L-1)->LINEAR->SIGMOID` model. This function will call `linear_activation_forward` iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find placeholders like `# YOUR CODE HERE` or `# YOUR CODE GOES HERE` where you need to add your implementation. Make sure to also return the `cache` at each step, as it stores values (like $Z$, $A_{prev}$, $W$, $b$) needed for backpropagation (which you might implement in a future exercise!).\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the functions, you can run the **Unit Test** cells to check your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Pay close attention to the dimensions of your matrices and vectors. Using `np.dot()` for matrix multiplication and broadcasting for biases will be key.\n",
    "\n",
